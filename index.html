  <h2>Project Ibix - Fall 2013</h2>
  <h3>Made with GameMaker Studio for a first-year course</h3>
  <img src="files/ProjectIbixScreenshot.png" alt="Project Ibix gameplay screenshot">
  <h4>Description</h4>
  <p>It's a 2D arcade-style action game with three weapons, four enemies, and 15 levels.  Unfortunately I seem to have lost the code for it!  Credits are in-game.</p>
  <h4>Links</h4>
  <a href="files/Project Ibix 0.7.1.6.exe">Download executable</a><br>
  <a href="../ProjectIbix">Play online (very buggy - strongly recommend executable; works better in IE than chrome)</a>
  <h4>Instructions</h4>
  <p>Controls and tutorial are in-game.  Press ESC to open pause menu, WASD to move, left/right mouse buttons and LShift to use weapons, Space to jump, W to dash.</p>
  <p>It is <b>strongly recommended</b> to play on Casual difficulty and use the "Auto select" feature when upgrading.  It's not balanced well.</p>

  <img src="files/ProjectQScreenshot.png" alt="ProjectQ gameplay screenshot" style="width:800px;height:450px">

  <p>Made by me and two other Waterloo students during the weekend-long November 2014 <a href="http://theplayfulpixel.ca/">GI Jam.</a>  We made it in Unity, which none of us knew very well, so we were learning as we made it.</p>

  <h2>Unity "tech demo" compilation - Fall 2014 / Winter 2015</h2>
  <h3>Early studies in Unity</h3>
  <img src="files/UnityDemoScreenshot.png" alt="Unity Demo screenshot" style="width:800px;height:380px">
  <h4>Description</h4>
  <p>I've fiddled around with Unity a few times and made some different "tech demo" projects.  They're all pretty unimpressive on their own, so I took the important features from each one and combined them into this.  The most interesting feature is the enemy pathfinding, using the <a href="http://arongranberg.com/astar/">A* pathfinding project</a>.</p>

  <a href="files/UnityDemo.exe">Download executable</a><br>
  <h4>Instructions</h4>
  <p>Controls are in-game.  Enemies move by cycling through fixed waypoints (unique for each enemy) - try placing walls in their paths and watch them path around them.</p>
